# A simulated city environment, such as CARLA (an open-source driving simulator), 
# is used to train A3C agents. The input to the model includes sensor data such as LiDAR, GPS, and camera feeds. 
# The agents learn to minimize collisions, fuel consumption, and travel time while navigating urban traffic.
