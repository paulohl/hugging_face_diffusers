# A simulated trading environment, such as OpenAI Gymâ€™s trading environments or custom-built datasets, 
# provides the agents with market state information. The state includes features like price trends, volatility indices, and momentum indicators. 
# Actions correspond to buying, selling, or holding assets, while rewards are based on portfolio performance.
