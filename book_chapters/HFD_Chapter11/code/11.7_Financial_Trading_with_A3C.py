# In financial markets, reinforcement learning offers a dynamic approach to developing intelligent trading agents 
# capable of adapting to volatile conditions and optimizing investment strategies. 
# The following code illustrates a simplified implementation of an environment for training A3C agents in financial trading scenarios, 
# emphasizing state-action interactions and reward-based learning mechanisms.

    def __init__(self):
        self.state = np.random.randn(10)

        reward = np.dot(self.state, action)
        self.state = np.random.randn(10)
        done = False
        return self.state, reward, done
# Placeholder for training logic
